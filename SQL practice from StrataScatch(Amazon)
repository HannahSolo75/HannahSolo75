Title: Monthly Percentage Difference
Level of Difficulty: Hard 
Company: Amazon
Table: sf_transactions

Given a table of purchases by date, calculate the month-over-month percentage change in revenue. 
The output should include the year-month date (YYYY-MM) and percentage change, rounded to the 2nd decimal point, and sorted from the beginning of the year to the end of the year.
The percentage change column will be populated from the 2nd month forward and can be calculated as ((this month's revenue - last month's revenue) / last month's revenue)*100.

WITH transactions AS (
SELECT DISTINCT
   to_char(created_at, 'YYYY-MM') AS date,
   EXTRACT(YEAR FROM created_at) AS year,
   EXTRACT(MONTH FROM created_at) AS month,
   SUM(value) OVER (PARTITION BY EXTRACT(MONTH FROM created_at)) AS total_value
FROM sf_transactions
ORDER BY to_char(created_at, 'YYYY-MM')
),

values AS (
SELECT 
    date,
    total_value,
    LAG(total_value) OVER (ORDER BY month) AS previous_month_value
FROM transactions
ORDER BY month
)

SELECT
    date,
    ROUND(((total_value - previous_month_value) / previous_month_value) *100 , 2) AS MoM_change
FROM values
