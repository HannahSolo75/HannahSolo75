Title: Users By Average Session Time
Level of Difficulty: Medium
Company: Meta/Facebook
Table: facebook_web_log

Calculate each user's average session time. A session is defined as the time difference between a page_load and page_exit. 
For simplicity, assume a user has only 1 session per day and if there are multiple of the same events on that day, consider only the latest page_load and earliest page_exit, 
with an obvious restriction that load time event should happen before exit time event . 
Output the user_id and their average session time.

WITH page_load AS (
SELECT
    user_id,
    timestamp
FROM facebook_web_log
WHERE action = 'page_load'
),

page_exit AS (
SELECT
    user_id,
    timestamp
FROM facebook_web_log
WHERE action = 'page_exit')


SELECT 
    pl.user_id AS user_id,
    AVG(pe.timestamp - pl.timestamp) AS avg_session
FROM page_load AS pl
INNER JOIN page_exit AS pe
ON pl.user_id = pe.user_id
GROUP BY pl.user_id
